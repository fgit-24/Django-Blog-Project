# PostIt - Social Media

**PostIt** is an innovative social media platform, built using Django, that allows users to interact in real-time.

Users can sign up with their username and email address to post whatâ€™s on their mind. Posts can be edited, deleted, and commented on by other users.

In addition, this platform includes a contact form and allows users to sign up for a newsletter.

# UX

It was important to me to establish a clear design structure in which users can easily find their way.

Everything is clearly laid out, and interactions are acknowledged with feedback messages.

Acceptance Criteria:

AC1: Posts should include a thumbnail image or media preview on the main page if one is available.
